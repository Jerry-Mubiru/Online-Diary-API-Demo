# Online-Diary-API-Demo
This is a project I am working on to get familiar with developing and working with APIs. I will be using the ASP.NET because of its C# implementation in collaboration with the Google Cloud Platform.

I am doing this in preparation for a larger project I am implementing so having a smaller project to work on is helping me understand key concepts that make successful implementation of APIs 
and online storage solutions.

I am very familiar with java so Working with C# object-oriented concepts comes easy to me. This is why I chose ASP.NET to create the API. ASP.NET also works well with the Google Cloud Platform which
is why I am using GCP for my database solution.
